â”‚14:17 <troido> I just mistyped botany as boatany. It could make a fun game
â”‚14:17 <troido> something idle like botany but you're on a boat instead
â”‚14:17 <troido> and instead of watering you scoop the water out
â”‚14:24 <cymen> maybe a new theme for #thebutton?
â”‚14:24 <cymen> if you don't scoop you drown :)
â”‚14:30 <cymen> troido: I feel like only preventing degradation would be very not fun
â”‚14:30 <cymen> might be some kind of weird psychological game though :p
â”‚14:31 <cymen> somebody should make extensions to that daily adventure
â”‚14:39 <-- netscape_navigator (netscape_navigator@localhost) has quit (Quit: WeeChat 2.8)
â”‚15:00 <gliggy> my plant just sprouted!!!
â”‚15:02 <gliggy> apparently it could be a venus flytrap, daffodil, or lithops
â”‚15:03 <diff> ðŸŽ‰
â”‚15:03 <demoji> <diff> :party_popper:
â”‚15:04 <m455> gliggy: hell yes
â”‚15:28 <unknownunknowns> I got a lil seedling now
â”‚15:28 <gliggy> cool
â”‚15:28 <unknownunknowns> boatany could float your lil boat around and maybe bump into other boats and/or islands
â”‚15:31 <unknownunknowns> and then you just see where your boat is that day and maybe do an interaction at the location
â”‚15:34 <gliggy> your boat's status could include supplies, if there isn't enough supplies you would have to stop at an island or trade with another boat
â”‚15:56 <@vilmibm> boatany++
